# LabPerks - Redeem your Shīnies

Besides spending your Shīnies on chat games you can also redeem them as LabPerks. I have added a few options, feel free to suggest more options.

| Command | LabPerk | Shīnies |
| ------- | ------- | ------: |
| !redeem 1 | "Timeout anyone in chat for 10 minutes!"  | 1 500 |
| !redeem 2 | "Play my hero request broadcaster!"  | 3 000 |
| !redeem 3 | "Unmod any of the channel mods for the remainder of the stream." | 5 000 |
| !redeem 4 | "Become a Swordpolisher!" WARNING! (Abuse -> Unmod -> No refunds!) | 25 000* |

\* *Only 10 left!*
